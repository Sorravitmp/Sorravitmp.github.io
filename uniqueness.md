| **Description**    | **. Uniqueness ensures that each data entry is distinct and without duplicates. Duplicate records can lead to inaccurate analyses and poor decision-making. To maintain uniqueness, organizations should implement duplicate detection and prevention mechanisms, regularly deduplicate their databases, and use unique identifiers for data entries.    **                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
